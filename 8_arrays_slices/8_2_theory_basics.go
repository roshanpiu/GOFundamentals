//arrays and slices are Numbered lists containing elements of the same type

//slices are used more is go than arrays
//arrays has a fixed capacity(length) slices has a flexible capacity(length)

//slices are built on top of arrays
//slices are references no data is sttored in slices
//slices references to the values in the array

//slices are passed to functions as references

//anytime we create a slice go creates a hidden array to store the data of the slice

//always use slices when ever possible
